A few highlights that set it apart from the rest are that it has a fully functional design, to the point that its stores are stateless (can you picture a stateless store?), a tiny API surface (and even its full weight is small, at 2kb of code added to the page), and the fact that it enables the use of a time-traveler debugger (sort of like the Elm language does).

At scale, any flaws in your frontend architecture has transformed into a nasty monster that will bite you in the ass at every opportunity. Thus - our repo is a monster zoo by now. We've managed to reduce the complexity in our app by utilizing React as our view layer. The functional and declarative way of programming is our bug vaccine, and reusable components is our consistency pill. The coexistence of React and Backbone is not entirely straightforward, but has helped us tremendously in dealing with our big state machine. This journey has taught us some valuable lessons. This is the story of how we used React to tame the single-page beast.">How we used React to tame the single-page beast</a>
